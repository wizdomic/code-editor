# 📝 Collaborative Code Editor

Welcome to the **Collaborative Code Editor**! 🚀 This application allows multiple users to edit code together in real-time, using **Socket IDs** for unique user connections and **Room IDs** for collaborative coding sessions. 👩‍💻👨‍💻

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Collaboration** 💬: Multiple users can join the same "room" to edit code together, with live updates for every change made.
- **Socket ID** 🔑: Each user gets a unique **Socket ID** to track their connection to the server.
- **Room ID** 🏠: Users can join a specific **room** to collaborate on coding projects. Each room is independent, allowing for multiple sessions at once.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Node.js** (for the server-side WebSocket connection) 🌐
- **Socket.io** (for real-time communication) 🔌
- **Frontend Editor** (integrate with Monaco, CodeMirror, or Ace Editor for code editing) 💻
